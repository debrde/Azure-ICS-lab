Questions regarding using Azure (DevOps)
+ Can I keep already configured VM disks after the weekly purge?
+ Is there a cost associated with the 'existence' of the VM disk if the compute instance is shutdown/deleted?

+ Can I build the pipeline to have stages that I can select/deselect when testing or deploying?

+ How to add the default deployment of packages to the pipeline? (VM provisioning and then installing git, iputils etc.)
+ How to run a shell script (PLCinit.sh) from the repo on a specific vm adter provisioning?
